We're using old terminology to describe a new phenomenon. "10x" belongs to the era of efficiency—doing the same work faster.

But the real shift isn't speed but **capability**. It's the difference between doing and becoming.  **AI eliminates the friction of becoming.**

We aren't witnessing 10x growth but <strong style={{color: '#ff2a6d'}}>10xy</strong>:
<div style={{paddingLeft: '1.5rem', marginTop: '0.075rem', lineHeight: '1.4'}}>
<span style={{display: 'block'}}><strong style={{color: '#ff2a6d'}}>x</strong> = Performance (Amplification of what you know)</span>
<span style={{display: 'block'}}><strong style={{color: '#ff2a6d'}}>y</strong> = Capability (Access to what you couldn't)</span>
</div>

Real leverage isn't a longer line but an expanding plane.
