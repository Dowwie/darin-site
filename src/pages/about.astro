		<p>I'm Darin.</p>
		<p>
			I am a <strong>Gonzo Engineer</strong> exploring the jagged edge of applied AI.
		</p>
		<p>
			The era of the "coder" is over. We are now orchestrators of chaos. Using Python, Rust, and Elixir, I build agentic systems that function in the real world, prioritizing raw capability over the comfort of tradition.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a chronicle of what happens when the silos collapse and the machine starts prompting us.
