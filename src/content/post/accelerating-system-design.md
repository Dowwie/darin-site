I conducted an interesting exercise today.  The goal was to take an accelerated path towards building an agent framework in Elixir based on insights gained from the most popular agent frameworks.  I created an agentic system, using Claude Code, to study 14 popular agent frameworks, creating subject matter insights as context to facilitate an elixir architecture discussion.  

How well did it do?  [Let me know on X](https://x.com/darin_gordon/status/2003951172730626215)
